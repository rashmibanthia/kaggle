# Google Quest Solution (wip)


bert_use_crawl.ipynb 
I had two separate models for question and answers. This file has training code for both these models. 
This is a fine tuned bert model - it includes the averaging of last 4 hidden layers + CLS token. 
Apart from that my model also includes, 
 - USE features 
 - crawl embeddings
